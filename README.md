# ML Model Deployment Guide: From Local to Cloud 🚀

## Breaking the Deployment Barrier for ML Engineers

Welcome! If you're an ML engineer who's built an amazing model but feels intimidated by deployment, you're in the right place. This guide demystifies cloud deployment, showing you it's not as scary as it seems.

## What This Guide Covers

We'll take your GPU-based ML model with a FastAPI wrapper and deploy it to production-ready endpoints on three major cloud platforms:

- **[Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - Complete Guide](./gcp-deployment.md)**
- **[AWS Fargate - Complete Guide](./aws-fargate-deployment.md)**
- **[Azure Container Instances - Complete Guide](./azure-deployment.md)**

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:
- ✅ A working ML inference code that requires GPU
- ✅ A FastAPI application wrapping your model
- ✅ Basic Python knowledge
- ✅ Basic command line skills
- ✅ A credit card (for cloud account creation - all platforms offer free tiers)

## What You'll Learn

### 1. **Account Setup & Authentication**
- Creating cloud accounts from scratch
- Setting up billing (with free tier guidance)
- Creating service accounts and API keys
- Managing permissions and roles

### 2. **Containerization Options**
- When to use Docker vs cloud-native build services
- Writing efficient Dockerfiles for ML models
- Optimizing container sizes for faster deployment
- Handling GPU drivers in containers

### 3. **Container Registry Management**
- Pushing images to cloud registries
- Managing image versions and tags
- Security best practices

### 4. **Deployment Strategies**
- Serverless vs always-on instances
- Auto-scaling configurations
- Load balancing setup
- Health checks and monitoring

### 5. **Cost Optimization**
- Choosing the right instance types
- Spot/preemptible instances for cost savings
- Monitoring and alerting for cost control

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | GCP (Cloud Run) | AWS (Fargate) | Azure (Container Instances) |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| **GPU Support** | ✅ (Preview) | ✅ (Via ECS) | ✅ (Limited regions) |
| **Serverless Option** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Auto-scaling** | ✅ Automatic | ✅ Configurable | ✅ Manual |
| **Cold Start** | ~5-10s | ~30-60s | ~20-30s |
| **Pricing Model** | Per request | Per hour | Per second |
| **Ease of Use** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Free Tier** | Generous | Limited | Limited |

## Your First Deployment in 30 Minutes

Each platform guide includes a "Quick Start" section that gets you from zero to deployed in 30 minutes. Here's what you'll do:

1. **Create an account** (5 min)
2. **Set up CLI tools** (5 min)
3. **Build your container** (10 min)
4. **Push to registry** (5 min)
5. **Deploy your model** (5 min)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### 🚨 "My container is 10GB!"
**Solution**: Use multi-stage builds, slim base images, and model optimization techniques covered in each guide.

### 🚨 "GPU drivers aren't working!"
**Solution**: Each platform guide includes GPU-specific base images and driver installation steps.

### 🚨 "My endpoint times out!"
**Solution**: Implement health checks, adjust timeout settings, and use async loading patterns shown in examples.

### 🚨 "Costs are exploding!"
**Solution**: Set up billing alerts, use auto-scaling, and consider serverless options detailed in guides.

## Which Platform Should I Choose?

### Choose **GCP** if:
- You want the easiest deployment experience
- You need generous free tier limits
- You prefer Google's ML ecosystem (Vertex AI, etc.)
- You want true serverless with GPU support

### Choose **AWS Fargate** if:
- Your organization already uses AWS
- You need fine-grained control over networking
- You want mature auto-scaling capabilities
- You need multi-region deployment

### Choose **Azure** if:
- Your organization uses Microsoft services
- You need Windows container support
- You want integrated Azure ML features
- You prefer per-second billing

## Sample FastAPI Structure

Here's what we're deploying:

```python
# app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
import torch
from your_model import load_model, predict

app = FastAPI()
model = None

@app.on_event("startup")
async def load_model_on_startup():
    global model
    model = load_model("path/to/model.pth")
    
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy"}

@app.post("/predict")
async def make_prediction(data: dict):
    result = predict(model, data)
    return {"prediction": result}
```
